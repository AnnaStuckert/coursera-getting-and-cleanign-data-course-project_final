This README explains the steps in the analysis file "run_analysis.R".
•	Step 0: load all data
•	Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Test and training datasets, subject ids and activity numbers are merged to obtain a single data set. 
•	Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
•	Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. -activity column given information on actual activities, not just proxy numbers.
•	Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. -renaming variables for more description
•	Step 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. -a final tidy data set is created with numeric variables that are averaged for each activity and each subject.

#codebook contains notes on the variables in the tidyed up dataset.
